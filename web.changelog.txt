index will render the leaderboard and have means to create errand actors
created leaderboard component
abandoned .web
	without error or warning, external project or nuget references kept being silently removed from the porject on build
	i havent been able to identify why this happens (could be version conflicts), but its still in preview mode so quirks are expected
	dont want to spend forever debugging something, will instead use a traditional mvc or angular project
