index will render the leaderboard and have means to create errand actors
created leaderboard component
abandoned .web (razor components)
	without error or warning, external project or nuget references kept being silently removed from the porject on build
	i havent been able to identify why this happens (could be version conflicts), but its still in preview mode so quirks are expected
	dont want to spend forever debugging something, will instead use a traditional mvc or angular project
attempted an angular web ui but abandoned in favor of the features embedded in razor pages, so .net core mvc ftw
